# AI-Powered_debate_simulation_system
This project is an AI-powered debate simulation system where two Agents - a Scientist and a Philosopher argue over a given topic. Using LangGraph for structured state transitions, the system tracks memory, manages turns, and automatically selects a winner based on argument strength.


## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Turn-based debate between AI agents
- Dynamic memory and transcript logging
- Judge node summarizes and selects the winner
