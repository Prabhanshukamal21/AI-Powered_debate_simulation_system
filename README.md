# AI---Powered_debate_simulation_system
This project is an AI-powered debate simulation system where two agents - a Scientist and a Philosopher argue over a given topic. Using LangGraph for structured state transitions, the system tracks memory, manages turns, and automatically selects a winner based on argument strength.
